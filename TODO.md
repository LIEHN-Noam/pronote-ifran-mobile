# API Integration Progress

## Completed Tasks âœ…

### 1. API Service Implementation
- âœ… Created `lib/services/api_service.dart` with login methods for all user types
- âœ… Added HTTP dependency to `pubspec.yaml`
- âœ… Implemented error handling and response validation

### 2. Helper Updates
- âœ… Updated `lib/helpers/users_helper.dart` to use API service
- âœ… Updated `lib/helpers/eleves_helper.dart` to use API service
- âœ… Updated `lib/helpers/parent_helper.dart` to use API service
- âœ… Replaced SQLite operations with API calls
- âœ… Added proper error handling for API failures

## Next Steps ðŸ”„

### 1. Update Login Screens
- [ ] Update `lib/screens/parent_login.dart` to use `ParentHelper.loginParent()`
- [ ] Update `lib/screens/teacher_login.dart` to use `UsersHelper.loginUser()`
- [ ] Update `lib/screens/student_login.dart` to use `ElevesHelper.loginEleve()`
- [ ] Update `lib/screens/login_screen.dart` to use appropriate helper based on user type

### 2. Navigation and Session Management
- [ ] Implement navigation to appropriate home screens after successful login
- [ ] Add session management (store user data, tokens if needed)
- [ ] Handle logout functionality

### 3. Error Handling and User Feedback
- [ ] Add loading indicators during API calls
- [ ] Display user-friendly error messages for login failures
- [ ] Handle network connectivity issues

### 4. Testing
- [ ] Test all login flows (parent, teacher, student)
- [ ] Verify API endpoints are working correctly
- [ ] Test error scenarios (invalid credentials, network issues)

## Notes
- All helpers now use the external API instead of local SQLite database
- API responses are expected to have a structure like `{"success": true, "user": {...}}`
- Delete operations are not implemented in the API, so they're marked as exceptions
- Make sure the API server is running on `http://127.0.0.1:8000` for testing
